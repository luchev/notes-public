A bridge made out of spider webs. It hangs over a river that seems too dangerous to swim through.
Going through the bridge anyone must make a DEX 12 saving throw to see if they get stuck to the bridge or can cross it just fine. If anyone gets stuck they can be saved by another party member with a STR 15 or INT 15 saving throw. Upon success they have to describe how they get them unstuck.
