An empty house that seems to belong to a wizard. It has old scrolls and books scattered around as well as many ointments, weird baubles and trinkets hung up on shelves.
The wizard is not at home. If the adventurers quickly look inside and leave, they will miss him, but if they linger around for longer the wizard will come back, and they will attack them for looting his home.
The loot that can be found in the house is:
- Scroll of fireball - 8d6 damage in a 20-foot radius, gold value: 500 gp
- Potion of Invisibility - lasts for 10 minutes
- Spellbook - contains spells such as Magic Missile and Charm Person, gold value: 3,000
- Ring of Protection - grants +2 to AC and saving throws, gold value: 2,500
- Staff of Healing - can cast Cure Wounds up to 2 times per day, gold value: 2,000
- Cloak of Elvenkind - grants advantage on Stealth checks and cannot be tracked by non-magical means, gold value: 1,500
- Bag of Holding - can carry up to 500 pounds without adding weight or bulk to the bag itself, gold value: 2,500
- Boots of Speed - grant an additional action per turn and double movement speed for one minute once per day, gold value: 5,000
