An old, crumbling water well that seems to be in the middle of nowhere. The well is completely dried out and seems to have been out of use for a while as there is no bucket or a rope. There seems to be something shining at the bottom of the well.
The party may choose to go down it with a rope, and at the bottom they will find a skeleton of a person. The skeleton is missing an arm, and its left leg bone is broken in two. There are also scribbles on the wall that seem to be counting days.
Next to the corpse is:
- Rusty short sword (+1 to attack, 1d6 damage) - 50 gp
- Rusty dagger (+1 damage, -1 to hit) - 5 gp
- Tarnished silver ring - no magical properties - 10 gp
- Leather pouch containing 5 gold coins and 15 silver coins
- Potion of Healing (2d4+2 health restored)
- Wooden carving of a fish - no magical properties - 5 gp
- Silver necklace with a small pearl pendant - no magical properties - 100 gp
- Cloak of Resistance (+1 to all saving throws) - requires attunement by a spellcaster or rogue - 100 gp
