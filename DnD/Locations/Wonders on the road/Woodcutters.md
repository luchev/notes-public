In the middle of a forest, a group of woodcutters seems to be sulking not knowing what to do. The horse of their cart has died, and they cannot bring the cart with wood back to the town, so they are stuck.
If the adventurers help them out in some way they will receive a reward from one of the woodcutters a god-tier axe, that was an heirloom of his grandfather, who was an adventurer, but passed away. The woodcutter doesn't know anything about the axe and has been using it to cut down trees. He sometimes notices the axe lighting up and is afraid it will burn him or the tree.
The axe is a two-handed battleaxe inscribed with runes, that seem to light up on the one side if you touch them.
