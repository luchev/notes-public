As the adventurers come close to the island, they start floating up and cannot control themselves. They are pulled towards the island and land on top of it. On top is a house surrounded by some trees and floating animals and bubbles of water.
Inside the house is a wizard who is not paying attention to the adventurers but is rustling around and tinkering quickly with different things.
```ad-info
The wizard has been playing with gravity magic and now everything around the island is being pulled towards it

As he rustles, a deer sprints into the house and crashes into his cabinet. The wizard proceeds to throw the deer out and complain.
