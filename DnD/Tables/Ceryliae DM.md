### Strength Skills

_Below are all the skills associated with the Strength ability._

| Athletics |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Feats of Strength - Other |                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy                      | Force open a stuck or broken door, break free from weak bindings, pull a stuck or wedged object loose                      |
| Moderate                  | Break through a wooden door reinforced with iron, hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it                         |

| Very Hard                 | Break through a heavy, reinforced door such as a prison or armory door, hold a door shut against a room filling with water |

1. A PC can climb and swim under normal conditions without having to make a check; however, strenuous conditions may require that they pass an Athletics check. Each foot of movement during such a check costs an extra foot of movement, or an extra 2 feet if it is considered difficult terrain. Characters with climb and swim speeds ignore the extra costs associated with movement of this type. Similarly, the horizontal and vertical distance a PC can jump without having to make a check is determined by their Strength score and modifier respectively. An Athletics check is generally only required when attempting to jump a distance farther than the amount calculate in the table above.  
2. During a vertical jump a PC can extend their arms in order to achieve an extra distance equal to 1⁄2 of their height, which they can effectively add to their jump distance in order to attempt to grab on to a ledge or other handhold.

## Dexterity

1. Generally, becoming hidden in combat requires being heavily obscured or under total cover, but ultimately the rules leave it up to your personal adjudication.  
2. Proficiency with Thieves' Tools allows a player to add their proficiency bonus to checks made to open locks and disarm traps.

On a failed throw the PC advances one level of [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion).                                                                                                                   |

#### Air Requirements
A PC can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 30 seconds). When out of breath, a PC can survive for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier before they drop to 0 hit points and begin to die.
#### Food Requirements
A PC must eat one pound of food per day in order to subsist. They can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before they begin to starve. This day count is reset when the PC eats their fill for a day; otherwise, the PC advances one level of [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion) at the end of each day beyond their limit.

| Water Requirements |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automatic          | A PC drinking less than half the amount of water they require during the day advances one level of [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion) at the end of the day, or two levels if they are already suffering from [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion).                                                       |
| Moderate           | A PC drinking more than half the amount of water they require during the day but less than the full amount must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or advance one level of [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion), or two levels if they are already suffering from [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion). |

1. Constitution represents a largely passive set of 'skills' which have more to do with enduring than performing a specific action the PC can become proficient in. Therefore, Constitution checks are more uncommon than other ability checks and are usually made without adding a proficiency bonus, although situational bonuses may still apply.  
NOTE: An ability check is different from a saving throw; players can be proficient at Constitution saving throws.  
2. A PC can only travel for eight hours a day before they risk becoming exhausted.  
3. A PC requires one gallon of water per day, or two if the climate is harsh.

## Exhaustion

### Exhaustion Levels

|Level|Effect|
|---|:--|
|1|Disadvantage on ability checks.|
|2|Speed halved|
|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|

1. Certain features allow you to make more than one attack, grapple, or shove with this action.  
2. These actions are optional and can be found on pages 271-272 of the DMG.

## The Rules of Stealth

When attempting to hide, there are 4 simple rules to remember.

1. If someone can see you, you can't attempt to hide from them.
2. Someone doesn't see you when they're not looking at you.
3. Once hidden, you can be detected via sight, hearing, or both, so don't be seen or heard. If their perception check or passive perception is higher than your stealth roll, they detect you.
4. You can hide in plain sight, given a moment of being unseen or unattended and an appropriate concealment strategy

If you are hidden, or when someone can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against them, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you make an attack while hidden, regardless of whether it hits or misses, you are no longer hidden.  

## Grappling, Shoving, and Climbing onto Bigger Creatures

When you take the [attack action](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#attackaction) you can use one attack to grapple, shove, or climb onto an enemy.  
### Grappling

You can grab a creature which is no more than one size category higher than you. Using at least one free hand, you make an Athletics check contested by the target's Athletics or Acrobatics check. If you succeed, the target is now [grappled](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#grappled) by you. You can also grapple an enemy to climb on top of it.

#### Escaping a grapple.

While grappled, a creature can use its action to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check opposed by your Athletics check. If the creature succeeds, it moves to a space next to you.

#### Moving a grappled creature.

When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

### Shoving

Using the attack action, you can attempt to shove a creature no more than one size larger than you. You make an Athletics check opposed by its Athletics or Acrobatics check. If you succeed you either move it 5 feet in any direction or knock it [prone](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#prone).

### Climbing onto Bigger Creatures

A suitably large creature can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. Once you make any ability checks necessary to get into position and to get onto the bigger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check contested by the targets Acrobatics check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space and clings to his body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.
The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature may or may not be able to attack the smaller creature, depending on the smaller creature's location, this is up to the DM. The larger creature can try to dislodge the creature as an action - shaking it off, scraping it against a wall, grabbing and throwing it off - by making an Athletics check opposed by the smaller creature's Athletics or Acrobatics check.

## Readying an Action

As an action on your turn, you can take the Ready action so that you may act later in the round using your reaction. To do this, you need to clearly define 2 things.
First, you must decide what circumstances will trigger your prepared action. For example, you could say that the trigger is "A hostile creature comes through the door in front of me".
Second, you must decide what you will do if the triggering event happens. You may take an [action](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#combatactions) such as the [attack action](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#attackaction) or you may move up to your speed. For example, you could say "I will attack with my greatsword".

When you put both the trigger and the action together you get a coherent sentence. The example is "If a hostile creature comes through the door in front of me, I will attack with my greatsword".

#### Readying A Spell.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you then release with your reaction. To be readied a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires [concentration](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#concentration). If your concentration is broken the spell dissipates.

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

### Death Saving Throws

When you start your turn at 0 hit points, you need to make a death saving throw. Rolling 9 and below counts as a failure, and 10 and above counts as a success. If you accrue 3 failures before 3 successes, you die. If you accrue 3 successes, you are stabilized. If you regain any hit points, both your successes and failures are reset.

#### Rolling 1 or 20.

When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

#### Damage at 0 Hit Points.

If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

#### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

#### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall [unconscious](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#unconscious). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

#### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw. You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Medicine check. A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

1. First and second level spellscasting services are easy enough to find in a decently sized city or town.  
2. Third level and higher spells are much more rare and can only be found with any amount of regularity in a large city, perhaps home to a University or Temple.  
3. Often times a spellcaster might ask for a service rather than monetary payment.

### Weapon Properties

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Ammunition|You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.|
|Finesse|When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.|
|Heavy|Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.|
|Light|A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.|
|Loading|Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.|
|Range|A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.|
|Reach|This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.|
|Special|A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).|
|(Lance)|You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.|
|(Net)|A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.|
|Thrown|If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.|
|Two-Handed|This weapon requires two hands to use.|
|Versatile|This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.|

## Resting

**Short Rest:**

- A period of downtime lasting at least one hour, during which time you can do nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, or tending to wounds.
- You regain the use of abilities, features, and resources that are refreshed by taking a Short Rest.
- You are allowed to expend one of your accumulated Hit Die by rolling a die of the corresponding type. You regain hit points equal to the rolled value + your Constitution modifier. Afterwards, you may choose to spend another Hit Die.

**Full Text:**

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous that eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Dice spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

**Long Rest:**

- A period of extended downtime lasting at least eight hours, during which time you must either sleep or perform only light activities such as talking, eating, or standing watch. These activities can occupy no more than 2 hours of your Long Rest. Performing more than an hour of strenuous activity such as walking or fighting will also interrupt your Long Rest. You may only benefit from one Long Rest in a 24-hour period and you must begin the rest with at least one hit point.
- You regain the use of abilities, features, and resources that are refreshed by a long rest
- You regain all of your lost hit points unless otherwise indicated.
- You regain a number of Hit Die equal to up half of your total possible Hit Die.

**Full Text:**

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest in interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of waking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity - the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them. For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

## Tying Knots

- The creature tying the knot makes an **Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check**

## Encounter Building

_You can use this process after you've already designed an encounter to determine its difficulty or you can use it to start an Encounter from scratch with a target difficulty in mind._

### Step 1

Start by making a note of the Exp values that define the four difficulty categories for your group. For each adventurer in the party refer to the [Encounter Difficulty Exp](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#encounterdifficulty) per Character table, noting the exp values for each character in each category. Then for each category add the exp values for each character in that category to determine the difficulty thresholds for encounters.

### Step 2

Next, select each creature you want to include in your encounter. Add up their Exp Values, which can be found in their stat block next to their Challenge Rating, to get the encounter's Exp Value.

### Step 3

Adjust the encounter Exp Value by the multiplier found in the [Encounter Exp](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#encounterexp) Multipliers table according to the size of the adventuring party.

### Step 4

Compare the adjusted encounter Exp Value with the difficulty thresholds you calculated in Step 1 to get an estimate of the encounter's difficulty. Adjust the encounter accordingly.
