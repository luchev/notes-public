> You are a looking for the [[Staff of the Abyss]]  to cause havock and destruction. In ancient scripts you've read that the staff looks like a wooden rod with a dysmorphed skull, that has gems embedded in it, and it has [[The Eye Gem]] in its right eye socket.
> The scripts mention how the staff was bestowed to a mortal by an eldritch lord. The mortal seek power and knowledge beyond the realms of man. Eventually, a being from the abyssal plane answered his calls and bestowed him the power he had desired, but at a great cost - the abyssal lord desired a great sacrifice - the lover of the mortal man. The abyssal being burned the man's wife alive, and her skull became the staff's focus. As she was burning alive, her boiling blood rose to her head and burst into her right eye, crystalizing into a blood gem.
> The mortal man used the staff to cause many atrocities and mass destruction. It is said whoever finds the staff will gain the same immense power and will rule the world with bloodshed and terror.

If the staff is combined with the [[The Eye Gem]], it will become [[Staff of the Abyss]] .
