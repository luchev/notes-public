# Story
The story takes place in the town of [[Ravenswood]].
The adventurers spawn in [[Ravenswood#Noticeable landmarks]] of their choice.
They either meet each other or NPCs and introduce themselves.

## The Festival
At the end of the day everyone goes to the festival in the middle of town where entertainers perform magical tricks, people are feasting, breathing fire, etc.
There is a man shouting for people to come and see his trick of turning staves into snakes.
A Halfling girl walks around and asks the people for a coin or two.
(Meanwhile, her twin brother steals the people's coin and belongings).
The players perform a WIS 15 saving throw to see if they notice anything.
Whoever notices something odd can perform a PER 15 to notice being robbed.
And then perform a Sleigh of Hand check with DC 15 to have only half of their items stolen, all are stolen if they fail (except weapons).
Then the performer and the halflings disappear into the crowd.
Optionally, the players can perform a DC 13 Perception check to look for the performers and fight them, but the goods are still stolen.
Example encounter at the square if the party decides to fight the performers.
