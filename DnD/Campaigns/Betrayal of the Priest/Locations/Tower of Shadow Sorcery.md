Entering the tower, the party would encounter the [[4-chains]] puzzle.
After figuring the puzzle out, they proceed to the stairs which lead a couple floors up.
On the stairs there is a [[Mirror Mirror]] trap.
On the upper floor, there is a door that opens into a room that has a pedestal in the middle holding [[Staff of the Abyss]] without [[The Eye Gem]].
The room is about 50ft in radius.
The pedestal is guarded by:
```encounter-table

```
Poison spray (10ft): CON 12 saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage.

```encounter-table
name: Tower patrol
creatures:
 - 1: [[Yuan-ti Pureblood, Patrol Pureblood]]
