An abandoned coal mine in the woods to the south of [[Ravenswood]]. Once upon a time dwarves and orcs used to excavate it, but now it's become hideout for [[Ravenhood (bandit group)]]. [[Karltan (Bandit Leader)]] resides here.

When the party arrives at [[Abandoned Coal Mine (Bandit hideout)]] they see in front 1 thief guard, who is not paying a lot of attention.
The party could choose to distract/dispose of the guard silently or fight him straight on.
If the party fights the guard and doesn’t kill him 1 in turn he will call for reinforcements, which are the main encounter - the Bandit Leader.
```encounter-table

If the party doesn’t alarm the bandit guard, they can surprise inside the Bandit Leader, who is in one of the rooms.
```ad-danger
title: Trap at the door
When entering the abandoned mine the first person entering must make a DEX 15 saving throw or be hit by a dart trap.
